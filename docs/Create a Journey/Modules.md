# Modules


## What is a module?

A module is a combination of a recommendation strategy with a relevant template to go with it. One or more modules can be placed on each touch-point (experience). The product recommendations are selected based on the strategy you choose and are rendered through the selected template.

VueX also supports modules that can have multiple strategies which can then be assigned to product tiles. In addition, VueX also allows manual addition (merchandising) of products in modules.
