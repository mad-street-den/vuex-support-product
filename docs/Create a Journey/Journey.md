# Journeys



## What is a journey?

A journey refers to customers’ life cycle of interactions with your site/app. This includes all touchpoints where your customers interacted before, during, or after buying your product or service.

Each journey differs and can happen in different phases such as brand awareness, considering purchase, intent to buy, actual purchase, and extend even to the loyalty phase.

Every customer journey is unique. With VueX, you can optimize personalized journeys, test the journeys to ensure they’re working for you and continually monitor them too.

With VueX, you can:
- Build personalized customer journeys across different touchpoints
- Optimize customer journeys by continuous A/B testing
- Monitor the performance of your customer journeys via an intuitive, detailed dashboard
