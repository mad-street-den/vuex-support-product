# Experiences



## What is an experience?

An experience is a customer touchpoint—the point of contact or interaction that your customer shares with your brand throughout the customer journey. These touchpoints can be pages on the site, a marketing email, an ad, ratings and reviews page, or a customer support center. Highly relevant and personalized experiences at every touchpoint are essential to engage and inspire shoppers, promote product discovery, and help nudge customers down the funnel by showing products they are highly likely to buy.

With VueX, you can create an experience for every page on the website by combining one or more modules. You can select a page to create the experience, add the recommendation module, and specify the modules' behavior and placement. Optionally, you can also configure business rules to modify the recommendation result. For example, you can set up an experience in the Cart page by placing modules such as “Customers who bought this also bought” and “Complete the Purchase” to prompt the customer to add additional items to the cart, thereby increasing the basket size.

Some examples of experience are listed below:
- Trending product recommendations on the home page to engage new customers.
- Similar Product recommendation on the product display page to showcase additional/relevant products from the catalog.
- Frequently Bought Together recommendation on the cart page.

## Create an Experience

1. Choose **Experiences** from the top navigation bar.
2. Click **New Experience**. The Manage Experience Page is displayed.
   **Note:** Verify that the chrome extension Vuex is installed. This will enable previews of the pages from your website in the app.
3. Enter a name for your experience.
4. Click **Select Page**, and choose the page type to create the experience.
5. Click **Next**. The selected page type is displayed in the preview pane.
6. Select the page from the page list.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Choose **Desktop** to create an experience for a desktop site or choose **Mobile** to create an experience for a mobile site.
9. Click **Add Module**.
   **Note:** You can add both API-enabled modules and embed code enabled modules to an experience.
10. To copy modules from your desktop site to mobile site:
    - Click **Copy module from desktop**.
    - Choose the module to copy.
    - Click **Next**.
    - Verify the placement of the module on your mobile site.
11. Choose the module to add to the experience from the listing page or create a new module.
    **Note:** You can add only one module at a time.
12. Click **Next**.
13. Choose the module behavior (pop-up or inline) from the Behaviour drop-down list.
    **Note:** Pop-up module enables you to add a button on your webpage, and on clicking the button, the module is displayed. The inline module enables you to place the module directly on your webpage.
14. If you choose pop-up behavior, then:
    - Choose the button style from the Button Style drop-down list.
    - Click **Select Placement** and move the cursor to position the module. You can also manually modify the placement path by clicking on **Edit Path** at the bottom.
    **Note:** You cannot verify the placement of the API-enabled module on the web page. API-enabled modules cannot be previewed.
15. Click **Confirm**.
16. Optionally, you can add business rules and filters by clicking **Add a new business rule**.
17. Click **Submit**.
18. To add more modules, repeat Step 9 to Step 15.
19. Click **Done**.
