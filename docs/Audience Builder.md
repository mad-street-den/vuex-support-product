# Audience Builder

Audiences refer to the different categories of visitors (shoppers) that enter your online store. In this section, we will look at audience presets, custom audiences, and audience data available to you.

There is a wide range of audiences that exist within the VueX app. In addition to this, custom audiences can easily be uploaded in the Audience Builder section of the product.

Anonymous and first-time shoppers are allocated to the most relevant segments, in real-time, based on behavioral data collected by the AI in that session. The AI uses current session data in combination with historic data to segment returning shoppers. Audiences are dynamic and can be recomputed at pre-decided time intervals.

An individual shopper might belong to multiple audiences (e.g., discount shopper + owner of abandoned cart).

## Audience Presets

A preset list of audiences has been configured based on specific behavioral criteria of the customers. So, every time there is a new visitor to the site, they are automatically assigned to one of these defined presets based on their behavioral characteristics. Audiences are recomputed once a day.

| Audience Preset                                  | Description                                                               |
